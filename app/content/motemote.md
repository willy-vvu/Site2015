Won the Best Overall project at [Hack@Brown 2015](http://hackatbrown2015.challengepost.com)!

My team and I created a multiplayer game that would be fun to join and leave on the fly. We were inspired by Super Sync Sports, a Chrome browser game which uses mobile phones as controllers for a shared web screening of the game. We also drew inspiration from Mario Party's bumper balls mini game for the gameplay. The game is targetted at casual gamers who just want to join and leave and play around. You can rack up kills (or deaths) for bumping other players off the arena stage, using either an on-screen joystick or tilt-sensing for movement. You don't even have to be near or looking at a screen to join as a player! Can support (in theory) infinite players for infinite bumping fun.
