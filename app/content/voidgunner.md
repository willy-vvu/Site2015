A massively multiplayer space shooter game, developed in 8 hours at MIT Blueprint 2015.

Our team won 3rd place in the main division!

With experience from Hack@Brown, I jumped into this project with networking know-how. My team and I were inspired by [XType](http://phoboslab.org/xtype/), though we formulated many more ideas that we didn't have enough time to implement. Overall, we tried to create gameplay that would be action packed and engaging, while being easy to join and leave on the fly.

An added bonus was that we could run the program on multiple computers next to eachother to expand the playable area - players and projectiles were able to cross in between screens seamlessly.
