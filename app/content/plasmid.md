A concept puzzle game about reversing colorful segments.

I started with the desire to create a puzzle game. A game that would challenge the mind in unexpected ways as a departure from contemporary games that don't require much thought.

What makes for a great puzzle problem to be solved? First of all, it should be simple. A simple puzzle is easily learned and explained, as well as motivating - solving a simple puzzle shouldn't be too complex, right? Secondly, it has to have a clear solution. Knowing exactly what you're looking for is the first step to solving it, providing another layer of clarity and motivation. Lastly, the puzzle needs to be varied and open to multiple methods of solving and puzzle creation.

With these goals in mind, I was inspired by linked lists and circular arrays. If the array had a clear order, items could be swapped to reestablish the order, similar to sorting. The more I thought about it, the better it seemed. Swapping multiple adjacent items would be like reversing segments. Reversal is varied by it's non-commutative property, simple in nature, and pairs perfectly with a circular array. I had the beginnings of plasmid.

Immediately, I began sketching simple levels using lines and numbers. I went through multiple iterations of the logo and various levels before I settled on using colors to denote a sorted order. The more I drew, the more absorbed I became. And so began the development.

Over the course of a few weeks, a game rose out of a soup of javascript, json, and images. I was unaware of CommonJS at the time, so I lumped all the code into one massive file. I crafted all text in vector graphics, letter by letter, as I had not conceived of a method of easily creating and using entire fonts in 3d. In addition to the messy files was the sub-par user experience. It was unclear what could and could not be clicked, let alone the confusing Campaign label that was essentially "Play" - I had dreamed of multiple play modes. I could have done a much better job, but all is currently in retrospect. The game stands as a proud achievement of a simple creative thought, desire, and determined effort.
