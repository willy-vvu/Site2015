A hackathon-winning project whose playful UI was written by me.

Kitty Byte Challenge is a Java programming site where you try to solve problems faster than others.
We want to make learning Java fun. Also, we want the Java learning experience to be accessible to
students who only have web browsing devices (such as some tablets, phones, school computers). Although
there are many online Javascript learning tools, Java is a different language from Javascript. Twenty
six thousand high school students take the AP Computer Science exam in Java every year, and many more
take Java classes. Additionally, Java is extremely popular in early university computer science programs.
We are building this for those students.
