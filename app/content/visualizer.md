A reactive, music-driven, 3D hexagonal surface.

You can use the provided music or microphone input to drive the visualization. Just click *Play* or *Allow Microphone Input* respectively.

Pushing my technical skills in terms of shader code, high-performance 3D graphics, and music visualization, this project was meant to be the backdrop of my website. However, it was removed to make way for something that would play better visually with the text and theme.
